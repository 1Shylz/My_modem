# My_modem
it works correctly but I don't know how.

I send data from "nums" and write the received data to "out ". The nuance is that the transmitter, namely hackRF, does not support a sampling rate of 2MHz, just like the receiver, namely RTL-SDR, does not support a sampling rate of 2 MHz. When I built these circuits, I did not fully understand how it all works. Now I understand that this should not work.
But for some reason it works. tell me why.
